# Circadian Hue Commercial License Agreement

Version 1.0 — January 2025

This Commercial License Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into by and between
Tallenholm ("Licensor") and the individual or entity that has purchased or
otherwise been granted a commercial license ("Licensee"). By installing,
accessing, or using Circadian Hue — Home Edition (the "Software") under this
Agreement, Licensee agrees to be bound by its terms. If Licensee does not agree
to the terms of this Agreement, Licensee may only use the Software under the
MIT License included with the distribution.

## 1. Grant of License

Subject to Licensee's compliance with this Agreement and payment of all
applicable fees, Licensor grants Licensee a worldwide, non-exclusive,
non-transferable license to:

1. install and use the Software in binary and source form for internal
   operations;
2. integrate, bundle, or embed the Software (in modified or unmodified form)
   within Licensee's products and services; and
3. distribute such products and services to third parties under Licensee's
   own terms without any copyleft or open-source distribution obligations.

## 2. Redistribution Rights

Licensee may redistribute the Software solely as part of an integrated product
or service that provides substantial, value-added functionality beyond the
Software. Licensee must ensure that recipients of Licensee's products or
services do not obtain direct access to the Software for standalone use unless
those recipients also hold a valid commercial license or comply with the MIT
License.

## 3. Source Code and Modifications

Licensee may modify the Software for Licensee's internal use or for inclusion
within Licensee's products. Licensee is not required to publicly disclose or
contribute modifications back to Licensor. However, Licensee must retain all
copyright notices included in the Software in any distributed copies.

## 4. Restrictions

Licensee shall not:

- sublicense, sell, lease, or otherwise transfer the Software on a standalone
  basis without Licensor's prior written consent;
- use Licensor's name, logos, or trademarks to market Licensee's products
  without prior written authorization;
- remove or obscure copyright notices or other proprietary rights notices; or
- use the Software in violation of any applicable law or regulation.

## 5. Support and Updates

This Agreement does not include support, maintenance services, or updates.
Such services may be provided under a separate support agreement at Licensor's
discretion. Licensor may, at its option, provide bug fixes or updates without
obligation.

## 6. Fees and Payment

The rights granted under this Agreement are conditioned upon Licensee's
payment of the commercial license fees as agreed in a corresponding order,
invoice, or master agreement. Fees are non-refundable once the license key or
access credentials have been delivered, except as required by applicable law.

## 7. Term and Termination

This Agreement is effective as of the date Licensee first receives the
Software under commercial terms and remains in force until terminated. Either
party may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days' written notice in
case of a material breach that remains uncured at the end of the notice period.
Licensor may terminate immediately if Licensee fails to pay required fees. Upon
termination, Licensee must cease use of the Software under this Agreement but
may continue to use it under the MIT License to the extent permitted thereunder.

## 8. Ownership

Licensor retains all right, title, and interest in and to the Software,
including all intellectual property rights. Except for the licenses expressly
granted in this Agreement, no other rights are conveyed, whether by
implication, estoppel, or otherwise.

## 9. Warranty Disclaimer

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. LICENSOR
DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE,
INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. LICENSEE'S USE OF THE SOFTWARE
IS AT LICENSEE'S SOLE RISK.

## 10. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE
FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES,
INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS, GOODWILL, OR DATA, EVEN IF LICENSOR
HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. LICENSOR'S TOTAL CUMULATIVE
LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED THE FEES PAID BY LICENSEE FOR
THE COMMERCIAL LICENSE DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING
RISE TO THE CLAIM.

## 11. Governing Law

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
of the jurisdiction specified in the applicable order or invoice. In the
absence of such specification, the laws of the jurisdiction in which Licensor
is headquartered shall apply, excluding its conflict-of-law rules.

## 12. Miscellaneous

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties regarding
the commercial licensing of the Software and supersedes any prior agreements or
understandings, whether written or oral. Any amendments or waivers must be in
writing and signed by both parties. If any provision of this Agreement is held
to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and
effect. Licensee may not assign this Agreement without Licensor's prior written
consent. Licensor may assign this Agreement in connection with a merger,
acquisition, or sale of substantially all assets related to the Software.
